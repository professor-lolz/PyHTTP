## üîç Description

This tool injects itself into a Python process and intercepts all outgoing HTTP/HTTPS requests, including:
- Standard requests via `requests`
- Asynchronous requests via `aiohttp`
- Low-level TCP connections via `socket`
- Requests via `http.client`

All intercepted data is saved to a timestamped `logging.txt` file.
